# A LITTLE ABOUT MY APP "MY READS"

The app was built with the intend to add new books and also move your books around between 3 distinguised shelfs. This was developed to keep track of what you are currently reading, what you want to read and what was read. There is allso a search bar where you can add books too which I think is pretty cool.

1) Currently Reading
2) Want to Read
3) Read

## INSTALLATION PROCESS

I used the starter file. I went on GitHub an cloned the project on my local computer via my IDE terminal as follows:

1) Open VS Code as my IDE.
2) Open your Terminal and paste the cloned url.
3) The actual file will normally sit in your users folder. Locate the folder and open it up in you IDE.
4) Run "npm install to install your node modules.
5) Run "npm start" to start the application.
6) Now you can start coding. 

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION

To run the My Reads project, I have exclided the modules due to size. So there is 2 steps to follow:

1) Run "npm install" (Your node_modules will now become visible).
2) Run "npm start" (your application would normally open up on port 3000 if its not occupied).
3) The Project will now open on your local host
4) I Hope you enjoy the app as much as I enjoyed creating it.
